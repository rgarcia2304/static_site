## A little About this Project

To be completley honest I never liked building things. In fact I built my first Lego Set when I was 21 years old. In contrast throughout my childhood I do remember finding passion in reading and imagining being in these elaborate worlds. These worlds often were of pure fantasy but man did they seem fun to live in. So I believe because it was instilled in me that my goal in life was to get to the bottom of why we are where we are in this world. Much to the the detroment of my family I would ask why about everything. As soon as I got my hands on a computer I would google the most insane stuff and how it worked. More than anything I loved finding out how we got here my true first passion was History.

But I am not pursuing a degree in History I am pursuing a degree in **Computer Science** and largley explore **Math**. To be completley honest I am the worst at Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. But in a large part I love it because there is so much to learn and more than anything it offers concrete explanitory facts of how the world works! I like to tell myself _playing to my strengths_ would have been easy, Easy is not fun, I sometimes lose myself programming and that's how stuff like this comes to be. Technology for better or for worse is the interface that touches our lives possibly the most, I want to be able to get to the bottom of knowing how this connects to humans and be able to tell the story of technology one day.

So This Project about me was built from scratch. The cool part about this is that we take Markdown Text which is a nice way of being able to write documents online and other static elements and turn it into language the computer can understand.
