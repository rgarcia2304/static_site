</code></pre><h2>A little About this Project</h2><p>To be completely honest I never liked building things. In fact I built my first Lego Set when I was 21 years old. In contrast throughout my childhood I do remember finding passion in reading and imagining being in elaborate worlds I read about in fiction. I am extremely grateful to have discovered a love for reading early.</p><p>My goal in life has always been to get to the bottom of how we got here. Much to the detriment of my family I would ask why about everything to everyone oftentimes without much care for how nosy I was being. You can only imagine as soon as I got my hands on a computer I would spend countless hours exploring <b>everything</b>. In my younger years I remember spending hours upon hours learning about history and politics around the world. History was my first passion.</p><p>But I am not pursuing a degree in History I am pursuing a degree in <b>Computer Science</b> and actually do a bunch of  <b>Math</b>. To be completely honest I do not play to my strengths and am actually the worst at Applied Mathematics and Computer Science amongst all my subjects in school. But in a large part I love it because it offers concrete explanatory facts of how the world works! <b>Math is one of the only things in life that does not lie</b>. I like to tell myself <i>playing to my strengths</i> would have been easy, Easy is not fun, I sometimes lose myself programming and that's how stuff like this comes to be. Technology for better or for worse is the interface that touches our lives possibly the most. I want to be able to get to the bottom of knowing how this connects to humans and be able to tell the story of technology one day.</p><p>So this project about me was built from scratch. The cool part about this is that we take Markdown Text which is a nice way of being able to write documents online and other static elements and turn it into language the computer can understand.</p><h2>Checkout Some Info Below</h2><h3>Important Stories and Life Lessons</h3><ul><li><a href="/static_site/essay/hope">Why we should have hope and keep on going</a></li><li><a href="/static_site/essay/optimistic">The Case for Always being Optimistic</a></li><li><a href="/static_site/essay/time">A lesson in Time Management</a></li></ul><h3>Some of my favorite books and content I've Looked at recently</h3><ul><li>Crime and Punishment</li><li>The Inner Game</li><li><a href="https://etc.cmu.edu/about/last-lecture">The Last Lecture</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/orQKfIXMiA8?si=HcqG7ipR0WRiKh60">Why you need to bored</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/persistence-work-difficulty.html">Do Hard Things</a></li></ul><h3>Movies I like</h3><ul><li>Good Will Hunting</li><li>Ratatouille</li><li>Indiana Jones Raiders of the Last Ark</li></ul><p>Want to get in touch? <a href="/static_site/contact">Contact me here</a></p></div></article>
