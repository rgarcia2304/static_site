    <article><div><h1>Essay on Hope</h1><h2>Where We currently Are</h2><p>It goes without saying that we are in a unique time in history. Today, I invite you to take a holistic view of society. Did you know that it takes only 6 people to reach any person on Earth. With the rise of social media and the internet you can or will run into someone who is probably less than 6 people away from anybody. Now pivoting to a different point, it is from my experience that the greatest indicator of happiness is one's sense of community and purpose. Before diving deeper into this, let's come back to the idea of the internet for a second though. The internet in my opinion is at the heart of sky high depression and unhappiness rates. On the contrary though, the internet is quite possibly the most brilliant invention ever. At face value the internet has united nearly the whole world, something unprecedented in history. With so much going on I decided to share my thoughts on some ideas that I find offer us as a humanity hope.</p><h3>So its poison</h3><p>When I was a child I could only gauge or compare myself to what I could really see. Sure television offered snapshots of false reality but much of the media I consumed was usually fantasy or material written for kids. Actually as I have gotten older I have found beauty in tv versus the short form content today. I think films and television at times really portray the common human experience well. Additionally, I have found that longer form content to serve as creative inspiration, but also recognized even when I was younger that that was not real life. What was all too real were the comparisons to others especially when people had cooler things than me like phones, clothes etc. Now looking back at those times, none of that mattered then but it was real life. Well lets now blow up that "reality" to the maximum extent with the internet. With the internet you now have access to everyone anytime anywhere. You have access to anyone anytime anywhere. So for one second let's take a step back and observe something interesting. On a common day you talk about things that you see with your family or friends. Memorable happenings on average tend to be things you see that are usually outlandish or crazy. Much of that memorable day to day seems to be on the internet nowadays. Think about this in history people probably saw memorable or remarkable things at only a speck of what you or I see everyday. According to ourworldindata.org there are over 5 billion people on the internet. So if you are online like most people in the world, wow I am still stunned by this fact, you see the good, the bad and the ugly. Unfortunately the poison stems from this incredible thing that connects us all, is that it provides a source to compare us all.</p><p>Lets do some quick math suppose that 1% of the population is remarkable. That would roughly translate to around 80 million people worldwide. You have no idea how to even gauge what 80 million people together look like physically. So circling back to the point that you remember the remarkable or crazy this somehow then becomes standard you should be. It seems common because so many people are doing crazy things and you are somehow left behind. There is one thing the internet abstracts and that is truly knowing the person or experience behind the work. It becomes easy to just stop trying things because it seems like everything is built or done already. The internet lets you just observe what is going on. That's the issue you just stop and watch, cutting the line of doing. Those dreams and aspirations you so dearly wanted to accomplish you see tens of thousands doing so what is the point. Why go to Paris if you can traverse the streets in google maps. Why learn Physics or read the Brothers Karamazov if it's been studied for years and all the work is there for us to observe and just not do anything. If everything is done why leave our imprint on it and muddy the work of these brilliant artists. The lineage is done then, so there is no point to keep going, all jobs hopes and dreams will fade to obscurity. Well let me offer you a perspective on why we should maybe have hope and that not all is lost. This generation was cursed with being able to see everything, this does not mean we experience everything. It is this experience that we get from doing things that is living. I guess the good thing is for you and me that there are still humans on this Earth to continue living.</p><h3>The key to living</h3><p>Many cite you need to have a goal in life to truly be happy, this in my opinion is a half truth. Goals goals goals, I am tired of hearing my goal is to be a millionaire or own 40,000 apartments. I mean to be fair at least these goals are tangible. These goals though suffer from the fact that if you get there it will not be enough. These goals are linked to only quick stimulus. Its pursuit of it will never be enough, and it will be challenging to potentially even get there because there's possibly no enjoyment in the path there. Money cannot produce the things that make us alive, genuine relationships and true passions. I want to make a point here, I have found it extremely beneficial in my life to have friends who are of no use to me. Many of my friends could not help me with many of the problems I face on a daily basis. But for some reason in many cases even though they are of no tangible value we would die for each other. Truly I am blessed to be able to just have fun and enjoy the nature of being social beings with the people I surround myself with. More so than anything it relaxes life to a point of just being, and I have found when we do have conversations about work or passions we pursue it actually tends to be beneficial to our lines of thinking. Funny enough there are tons of patterns that are true across any walk of life. I could talk all day about these patterns but most of them boil down to being humble, working hard, and being honest. Truly I do believe if you are practicing all three of these you don't have to worry about much else. Those human connections make up one of the most wholesome parts of being alive. In school I grew impassioned with the Renaissance in school partly because of the educators I had and also because of my deep infatuation with history. So what if I told what I remember the most from the Colosseum was not the magnificent stadium. It was goofing around taking pictures with people just having fun. This shifted my mind because I now understood having goals was one thing, but having people was a much more valuable thing.</p><p>Another huge thing I think that is key to living is time. So I mentioned many strive for wealth because it will give them freedom. I too thought like this at one point of my life. Believe it or not I had once told my teacher I would probably be done with Software engineering after a few years, retire a millionaire, have financial freedom off my investments, and just take a chill bureau job to make easy money ha. Well first of all even if that was my goal it now seems very infeasible. The rise of so many things I did not expect in the world have happened between now and then. Takeaway: do not try to predict the future or have idealistic hopes riding on it. Life is very unpredictable and you may be insanely disappointed by it. So back to time we have less time than we think, to be blunt with you. Since I have turned 18, time has flown by in the blink of an eye. From talking to people, life just speeds up even more the older you get. So if your dream is to get rich so then you can pursue what you want or be happy without worrying about money, just know the mystery of the future may await you. Death is the only thing certain in this life and many times it comes at unexpected times. Just know that chance may have it that you will meet your end or decline in health far sooner than you anticipated and what then. So in this finite time we have I suggest going for it. The worst thing that can happen is that you end up exactly where you started, but without the what ifs. Best case is that you meet some people along the way who propel you to where you want to go. To those who have inspired or supported me who are too many to list, I'm often brought to tears by putting into thoughts or words how much you have all meant to my life and happiness on the journey in pursuit of my dreams. So, make the most of every day. Not everyday will be easy but do as much as you can in pursuit of your dream, and it just may come true. One thing I hear often is I want to do this or do that but it isn't happening because of xyz. On rare occasions I have heard valid excuses for why you can't accomplish what you want to right now. Just make sure to fully go for it. It's extremely important for happiness to keep on learning and doing hard things everyday. I promise even if you don't get there you will get exactly where you are supposed to be. Remember if you have less time than you think, go for it. I have written or will write another essay on time management, go check that out to see what I have done to make the most of my little time here on Earth.</p><p>This sounds awfully idealistic, you say, if time is what’s really valuable ,and I pursue something that doesn’t make me money, am I supposed to suffer in poverty? Well first of all yes I believe you should suffer but choose your hard. At the end of the day remember you do have time in the day to work and follow your passions. Your passions are why you live, you may have to work an odd job or two before getting what you want but that's the point. If things were immediate or easy there would be no reward. Money also from my experience follows if you do brilliant work in your field so it is worthwhile to get good at something. It is a lot easier to get good at something if you are passionate about it. Trust me I have worked as a landscaper and construction worker in my free time off school and university, but it was all contributing to the bigger picture. I would much rather be tired from working towards my dreams then tired from all the mental pressure of the what ifs. I believe that type of tiring pressure is worse and as we get older we have less freedom depending on what you want from life. Everything can change today, you just have to do it.</p><h2>A Note to Hope</h2><p>Now I must admit I have stolen too much of these teachings from various things I have read, heard, and experienced. To be honest it would be impossible to cite but hey I am not claiming to be great but..</p><blockquote> "a good artist copies, a great artists steals"</blockquote><p>I have had the privilege to go somewhere with no internet, throughout my life. My parents homeland is situated in Michoacan, Mexico, a wonderful place to experience a really rich culture and life. Due to this, I have seen the sky and moon in full clarity and absolute silence. In this part of Mexico there is very little industry or development. Yet somehow from some point in time on Earth people have taken us from some beginning with nothing to the moon. No chance people thought it would ever be possible in any point of history... except it happened. Someone believed it could and obviously it had taken hundreds of years of development to get there but it all started with the dreams of groups of people. So I encourage everyone to take a moment and realize that change is possible, and you can make the mark in what you are passionate about. Though I do suggest do not limit yourself to one thing.</p><p>It is quite famous that it takes 10,000 hours to master something. I present this alternate perspective, which is not original but I think it's important to explore many things. This will develop your way of thinking and understanding of the true world and its people. From these experiences you can then bring those different perspectives to the table when pursuing your passion. Those different perspectives are what drive innovation and change. We will and have always needed good passionate people. Expertise is desirable in any field, but just know it can look in so many different ways. It may not happen today, tomorrow or in the next 5 years but maybe just maybe if you try you can make change. Vincent Van Gogh found painting at 28 and the founder of Nintendo started at 29. Both of these two individuals held various jobs or experiences leading up to these endeavors which changed the world. On a side note, humans are the most valuable asset we have in this world. Treat all you come across as best you can because you may just empower them to do something great. So I do not think I am crazy in saying I have hope and more than anything believe that incredible things will continue to happen on this Earth. As long as people continue being curious and enjoying the common human experience the beacon of light that is hope will continue to shine.</p><h2>How this is relevant to me</h2><p>Well, well I think I would share a little bit about what drives me. Firstly, I would like to share sincere gratitude to everyone who has ever helped me I do plan on paying forward as I believe all should. So this is not my magnum opus but its taste of showcasing what I am currently inspired by. One of my dreams was to travel the world and be a journalist to document the beautiful cultures of the world. This dream has molded into that of me wanting to still make some journalistic content but with more focus on general life specifically technology. Although this has been done before, creators in the space actually inspires me to pursue it. I believe maybe my unique value can come from my previledge of being raised in a household with rural roots and no lineage of higher education. Further more I am completley fascinated by philosophy, history, and pyschology. To be completley honest I want to pursue deep understanding in how interfacing with technology is changing society. Beyond this theres a bunch of things I will do like learn to play tennis, ski, to cook, to learn french (fingers crossed) but those are goals and goals change but at least they give me something to preoccupy my time with. More than anything I really want to take my career in software engineering as far as possible to eventually find fun ways to get the youth curious about something that seems so scary and hard to get into. I am hopeful that one day I can get other people dreaming and hopeful about this amazing world we live in!</p><p>-Cheers  Rodrigo</p></div></article>
